JSX & Props
=============================

## SWBATs
- [ ] Understand how `create-react-app` works and what it offers a developer
- [ ] Organize code into files and use the import-export syntax to pass ddata between components
- [ ] Use props to make components more dynamic and reusable
- [ ] **BONUS** Use the `children` prop 

## SWBATs (Part 2)
- [ ] Add event handlers to elements in React
- [ ] Explain why we have Synthetic Events
- [ ] Instantiate `state` inside and outside of the `constructor`
- [ ] Create event handler callbacks that manipulate `state`
- [ ] Trigger rerenders by calling `setState`
- [ ] Manipulate the DOM by changing values in `state` instead of using vanilla JS
- [ ] Correctly choose when to use `props` vs `state`, and explain why one would use one or the other
