JSX & Props
=============================

## SWBATs
- [ ] Understand how `create-react-app` works and what it offers a developer
- [ ] Organize code into files and use the import-export syntax to pass ddata between components
- [ ] Use props to make components more dynamic and reusable
- [ ] **BONUS** Use the `children` prop 

## SWBATs (Part 2)
- [ ] Add event handlers to elements in React
- [ ] Explain why we have Synthetic Events
- [ ] Instantiate `state` inside and outside of the `constructor`
- [ ] Create event handler callbacks that manipulate `state`
- [ ] Trigger rerenders by calling `setState`
- [ ] Manipulate the DOM by changing values in `state` instead of using vanilla JS
- [ ] Correctly choose when to use `props` vs `state`, and explain why one would use one or the other



## Notes

1. Can you use if/else in a render? Technically yes, effectively no. Inside of return you cannot and need to use ternary
2. Arrow functions & binding to the class 


Afternoon goals:
1. Take questions!
2. Talk component planning & hierarchy
3. Build out our basic wireframe
4. Events & Synthetic Events in React
    Important concepts: Reference v. Invocation, Arrow Functions and Binding, Event Pooling
5. When you need Class components: State or Lifecycle Methods 
6. State
7. Manipulating State

Features: 
- Match Wireframe & render all info
- When 'Select Game' is clicked, show an alert with the game's name
- When 'Like' is clicked, increase the number shown
- GET Fetch all games from the json-server 
- Split the card so the front is just the name, and on click it shows the back with all of the info



Before we go to discuss...
- Priorities for the rest of the day
